# Node Version Manager Configuration
# This file specifies the Node.js version to use for the Goat Prediction Ultimate project

# Main Node.js version (LTS - Long Term Support)
18.18.2

# Explanation of version choice:
# - 18.18.2: Latest LTS version with security patches
# - LTS support until April 2025
# - Includes ES2022 full support
# - Stable for production use

# Version format: <major>.<minor>.<patch>
# 
# To use:
# 1. Install nvm: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
# 2. Run: nvm install
# 3. Run: nvm use
#
# Alternative commands:
# - nvm install 18.18.2  # Install specific version
# - nvm alias default 18.18.2  # Set as default
# - nvm current  # Check current version
# - nvm ls  # List installed versions

# Development environment setup
# For consistent development across team members

# Minimum requirements:
# - Node.js: 18.18.0 or higher
# - npm: 9.x or higher
# - nvm: 0.39.0 or higher

# Node.js 18 features used in this project:
# - Fetch API (stable)
# - Node.js Test Runner (stable)
# - Web Streams API (stable)
# - JSON Import Assertions
# - Built-in test coverage
# - Pattern matching

# Package manager: npm (included with Node.js)
# We use npm for consistency with Node.js LTS releases

# To verify installation:
# node --version  # Should show v18.18.2
# npm --version   # Should show 9.x.x or higher

# For development tools:
# - npx: Included with npm
# - nodemon: For development auto-restart
# - ts-node: For TypeScript execution

# Production considerations:
# - Docker images use node:18-alpine
# - Alpine reduces image size significantly
# - Security updates are applied automatically

# Troubleshooting:
# If nvm install fails, try:
# 1. nvm install 18
# 2. nvm install --lts
# 3. Check network connectivity

# For CI/CD pipelines:
# Use this exact version to ensure consistency
# GitHub Actions: actions/setup-node@v3 with '18.18.2'

# Note: Do not use odd-numbered versions (19, 21, etc.)
# as they are not LTS and have shorter support cycles

# This project requires specific Node.js features:
# - ES modules support
# - Top-level await
# - Import assertions
# - Stable test runner
# - Performance improvements in V8

# Memory considerations:
# Node.js 18 has improved memory management
# Recommended: 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB+ for development

# Platform support:
# - Linux: Full support
# - macOS: Full support
# - Windows: WSL2 recommended for development

# Security:
# - Regular security updates
# - OpenSSL 3.0
# - Improved crypto APIs

# Performance:
# - V8 10.2
# - Faster startup times
# - Improved garbage collection

# Development tools compatibility:
# - TypeScript 5.x
# - React 18
# - Next.js 14
# - Jest 29
# - ESLint 8
# - Prettier 3

# To update to newer LTS versions:
# 1. Check compatibility: nvm install 20
# 2. Test: npm test
# 3. Update .nvmrc file
# 4. Update CI/CD configurations
# 5. Update Dockerfiles

# Backup version (if 18.18.2 has issues):
# 18.17.1  # Previous stable LTS

# Development only - not for production use:
# node  # Latest (unstable)
# 20    # Current LTS (after 18)
