# 6. Update Dockerfiles

# Backup version (if 3.11.7 has compatibility issues):
# 3.11.6  # Previous patch version
# 3.10.12 # LTS version with longer support

# Version compatibility matrix:
# - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS: Native 3.10, but 3.11 works
# - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS: Needs PPA or pyenv
# - macOS Monterey (12+): Native 3.9, but 3.11 via pyenv
# - Windows 10/11: Via python.org or pyenv-win

# CI/CD pipeline configuration:
# GitHub Actions: actions/setup-python@v4 with '3.11.7'
# GitLab CI: image: python:3.11.7-slim
# CircleCI: image: cimg/python:3.11.7

# Virtual environment best practices:
# 1. Always use virtual environments
# 2. Never install packages globally
# 3. Use requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
# 4. Pin exact versions for production
# 5. Use pip-tools for dependency management

# Python implementation options:
# - CPython: Standard implementation (recommended)
# - PyPy: JIT compiler (good for some workloads)
# - Anaconda: Data science distribution
# - Miniconda: Lightweight alternative to Anaconda

# For data science/ML workloads:
# Consider Anaconda if:
# - Need many scientific packages
# - Working on Windows
# - Need MKL-optimized numpy
# Otherwise, use CPython with pip

# Environment variables for optimization:
# export PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX="$HOME/.pycache"
# export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1  # In production
# export PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2  # In production
# export PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1  # For debugging

# Memory management:
# Python 3.11 has improved garbage collection
# For large ML models, consider:
# - Increasing memory limit
# - Using generators instead of lists
# - Using numpy arrays efficiently
# - Using memory-mapped files for large datasets

# Concurrency model:
# - asyncio for I/O-bound tasks
# - multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks
# - concurrent.futures for simple parallelism
# - threading for I/O with GIL limitations

# Package management strategy:
# 1. Base dependencies in pyproject.toml
# 2. Pinned versions in requirements.txt
# 3. Development dependencies in requirements-dev.txt
# 4. ML-specific dependencies in requirements-ml.txt

# Testing strategy:
# - pytest for unit tests
# - hypothesis for property-based testing
# - pytest-asyncio for async tests
# - pytest-cov for coverage
# - pytest-xdist for parallel testing

# Code quality tools:
# - black: Code formatting
# - isort: Import sorting
# - flake8: Linting
# - mypy: Type checking
# - bandit: Security scanning
# - safety: Dependency security

# Documentation:
# - Sphinx for API documentation
# - MkDocs for user documentation
# - pydoc for module documentation
# - doctest for example testing

# Deployment considerations:
# - Use gunicorn/uwsgi for WSGI apps
# - Use uvicorn for ASGI apps (FastAPI)
# - Use nginx as reverse proxy
# - Use supervisor for process management
# - Use docker for containerization

# Monitoring and logging:
# - structlog for structured logging
# - sentry for error tracking
# - prometheus for metrics
# - grafana for dashboards

# Performance profiling:
# - cProfile for CPU profiling
# - memory_profiler for memory usage
# - py-spy for sampling profiler
# - line_profiler for line-by-line profiling

# Debugging tools:
# - pdb for command-line debugging
# - ipdb for IPython-enhanced debugging
# - pudb for visual debugging
# - debugpy for VS Code debugging

# Note for Windows users:
# While Python 3.11 works on Windows, some ML packages
# may have installation issues. Consider:
# 1. Using WSL2 (recommended)
# 2. Using conda for package management
# 3. Using pre-built wheels when available

# Enterprise considerations:
# - Python 3.11 is supported by Red Hat, Ubuntu LTS
# - Available in official repositories
# - Security updates provided
# - Compatible with enterprise security scanning

# Long-term support:
# Python 3.11 will receive security updates until Oct 2027
# This provides ample time for migration to newer versions

# Development workflow:
# 1. Clone repository
# 2. Run: pyenv install 3.11.7
# 3. Run: python -m venv .venv
# 4. Run: source .venv/bin/activate
# 5. Run: pip install -e .[dev]
# 6. Run: pre-commit install

# Production workflow:
# 1. Use Dockerfile with python:3.11-slim
# 2. Multi-stage build for smaller images
# 3. Install only production dependencies
# 4. Run as non-root user
# 5. Set appropriate resource limits

# For contributors:
# Please ensure you're using Python 3.11.7
# This ensures consistency across the development team
